### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Project 1: President Speeches Analysis
+ This project is conducted by [Jingkai Li]

+ Project summary: I focused maily on the "negative word/positive word" ratio to see which president/party/type of speech are more likely to use positive words. The results show that the difference of ratio is mainly because of the current political situation the US was in, and also when the presidents' speaking situation makes ratio different, as from nomin to inaug and to farewell. Next I tried to figure out the complex words in each sentence of the speeches, and tried to find out which president uses more complex words. It is said that the number of complex word in a sentence influenced the complexity of sentence in the speech, which reflect the literature attainment of the speaker(I assume that the speech is written by the president). Surprisingly, President DonaldJTrump is the highest five of using complex words. :)
